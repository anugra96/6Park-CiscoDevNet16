    Python
        Python is normally pre-installed on Mac OS and most Linux distributions.
        You can also install Python on Windows.
        First, check see if you have Python installed on your system.
        Go to your command prompt and type “python”.
        If you get an error, follow the installations to install python for your system type from this page - http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html
    You will also need to install the Requests Library for Python.
        This is a library that makes it very easy to call REST APIs.
